# Password Strength Background

If deployed: https://thedanitor.github.io/password_strength_background/

This project is from the Day 39 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

This was a very simple project with a password input field and a blurry background image. The longer the password is that gets entered the more clear the background image becomes. It's a cool idea and could be expanded upon by checking for special characters. This was also my first introduction to the tailwindcss framework and it seemed very user-friendly. I looked at the documentation and am pretty impressed. It seems very customizable and the class names are pretty semantic. I will certainly keep it in mind for future projects.
